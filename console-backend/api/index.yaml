        Labels selectors.

        Labels are arbitrary \<key\>:\<value\> pairs that can be associated with a resource.
        A selector matches labels values using equality, inequality and filtering.
        It can check the existence of a label key, ignoring the value.<br/>
        To summarize, there are 6 available operations and their associated symbol :
          * equality: `=`
          * inequality: `!=`
          * filtering: `in`
          * negative-filetering: `notin`
          * existence: `<key>`
          * non-existence: `!<key>`

        For example :<br/>
        `zone=europe` will match a label where the value for key `zone` is equal to `europe`. <br/>
        `zone!=europe` will match all the labels where the value for key `zone` is not equal to `europe`. <br/>
        `country in (france, germany)` will match all the labels where the value for key `country` is equal to `france` or `germany`. <br/>
        `country notin (spain, italy)` will match all the labels where the value for key `country` is not equal to `spain` or `italy`. <br/>
        `power` will match all the labels where the key `power` exist, regardless of the value. <br/>
        `!power` will match all the labels where the key `power` do not exist.

        Multiple selectors can be submited, separated with a coma. A coma implies a AND operation between selectors.<br/>
        This is modeled after the [kubernetes labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/).
