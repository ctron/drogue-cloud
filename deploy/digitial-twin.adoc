= Digital twin

NOTE: All commands are relative to the root of the repository.

[NOTE]
====
You will need a Kubernetes installation supporting the
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/[Ingress] resource, or OpenShift with routes.

Using Minikube, you can enable the `ingress` addon, using `--addons=ingress`.
Kind also allows using https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/ingress/[Ingress].

== Setup

Additionally to the basic deployment, you will need to install the following components:

=== Vorto API token (optional)

NOTE: This step is not required by the default example in this tutorial. However, you might need it, if you want
to further experiment with Ditto and Vorto.

If you want to use private models or mappings from the Vorto repository, you will need to register an account at
https://vorto.eclipse.org. The account will be backed  by another identity  provider (e.g. GitHub), and you
will need to create an access token for this identity, using the chosen identity provider.

Assuming you are using GitHub as identity provider, you need to create a GitHub personal access token, granting
the following permissions:

* `read:user`
* `user:email`

With this token create a Kubernetes secret using the following command (be sure to replace `<my-token>`):

----
kubectl create secret generic vorto-api --from-literal=token=<my-token>
----

=== Deploy

Deploy all components using:

----
# Minikube
env CLUSTER=minikube ./scripts/drgadm deploy-twin

# Kind
env CLUSTER=kind ./scripts/drgadm deploy-twin

# OpenShift
env CLUSTER=openshift ./scripts/digital-twin.sh
----

When the script finishes, it will print out some example commands to try. These are the same commands as the
following sections of this document use. Only they already contain the correct information, so you can
simply copy and past them.

== Using

=== Create a device in Ditto

First you need to create a device in Ditto. For this we need the description of the device. The description is
stored in the public Vorto repository (https://vorto.eclipse.org), and the device description can be exported
using the following command:

----
MODEL_ID=io.drogue.demo:FirstTestDevice:1.0.0

http -do FirstTestDevice.json https://vorto.eclipse.org/api/v1/generators/eclipseditto/models/$MODEL_ID/?target=thingJson
----

This will store the device description in the file `FirstTestDevice.json` of your local file system. The content
should look like:

[source,json]
----
{
  "definition": "io.drogue.demo:FirstTestDevice:1.0.0",
  "attributes": {
    "modelDisplayName": "FirstTestDevice"
  },
  "features": {
    "temperature": {
      "definition": [
        "org.eclipse.vorto.std.sensor:TemperatureSensor:1.0.0"
      ],
      "properties": {
        "status": {
          "value": 0
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

With this device description, we can create a new device in the Ditto system:

----
DEVICE_ID=my:dev1
TWIN_API="https://ditto:ditto@ditto-console-drogue-iot.apps.my.cluster"

cat FirstTestDevice.json | http PUT "$TWIN_API/api/2/things/$DEVICE_ID"
----

As a result, you should receive:

----
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
…
----

If the device already existed in the Ditto system, then it would update the device with the newly provided
definition and instead return:

----
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
…
----

=== Publish data

----
ENDPOINT="https://http-endpoint-drogue-iot.apps.my.cluster"
DEVICE_ID="my:dev1"
CHANNEL="foo"
MODEL_ID="io.drogue.demo:FirstTestDevice:1.0.0"

http -v POST "$ENDPOINT/publish/$DEVICE_ID/$CHANNEL" "model_id==$MODEL_ID" temp:=1.23
----

NOTE: You can use the script `./scripts/publish_loop.sh` to generate a constant stream of simulated temperature readings.

=== Fetch from Ditto

The simulated temperature readings are now published to the HTTP endpoint. On reception, the data is still directly
stored in the Kafka stream. Additionally to InfluxDB, it will now be also available in the Ditto instance. You can
retrieve the current state of the device using the following command:

----
TWIN_API="https://ditto:ditto@ditto-console-drogue-iot.apps.my.cluster"

http "$TWIN_API/api/2/things/$DEVICE_ID"
----

This should return the current state, in the normalized Ditto format:

[source,json]
----
{
    "attributes": {
        "modelDisplayName": "FirstTestDevice"
    },
    "definition": "io.drogue.demo:FirstTestDevice:1.0.0",
    "features": {
        "temperature": {
            "definition": [
                "org.eclipse.vorto.std.sensor:TemperatureSensor:1.0.0"
            ],
            "properties": {
                "status": {
                    "value": 0.052751
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "policyId": "my:dev1",
    "thingId": "my:dev1"
}
----

== What just happened

In the first tutorial, we published a device message to the cloud, processing it with Knative eventing and storing
the result, the temperature, in an InfluxDB.

While this was easy, there is a downside: the device, and the service pushing data to InfluxDB, need to agree on
a data format. As would everyone else, processing this data. And while InfluxDB can provide us with a nice history,
it can quickly get tricky to store a more complex device state.

So now we process the incoming data, using a Vorto model transformation. This translates the device specific
payload:

[source,json]
----
{ "temp": 1.23 }
----

Into a canonical data format:

[source,json]
----
{
  "temperature": {
    "value": 1.23
  }
}
----

Which allows us to also convert this into an Eclipse Ditto update request:

[source,json]
----
{
  "headers": {
    "response-required": false
  },
  "path": "/features",
  "topic": "my/dev1/things/twin/commands/modify",
  "value": {
    "temperature": {
      "definition": [
        "org.eclipse.vorto.std.sensor:TemperatureSensor:1.0.0"
      ],
      "properties": {
        "status": {
          "value": 1.23
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

As you can see in the model, we are actually re-using a temperature sensor
definition (`org.eclipse.vorto.std.sensor:TemperatureSensor:1.0.0`) from the public Vorto model repository.

[NOTE]
.Public Vorto repository
====
The Eclipse Vorto project hosts a publicly available Vorto instance. In this repository you can find existing
data types, partial models ("function blocks"), as well as completely mapped devices.

You can use this instance for experimenting with the technology, and for sharing your own mappings. But of
course you can also run your own instance of Vorto.
====

The Knative eventing system is configured to create a new flow. Processing events from the same source as the
"InfluxDB pusher", the Kafka stream. However, instead of directly processing the events, it runs this through
a "sequence", translating events in the process:

.Flow of events
image::../images/digital-twin.svg[Flow of events]

The first step translates the events using the Vorto mapping engine. The second step forwards the converted events
to the Ditto API.

Ditto will store a "most recent" version of the full device state, and we did query that with the last command.
