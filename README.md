> Cloud Native IoT.

Drogue IoT Cloud is an IoT/Edge connectivity layer that allows IoT devices to communicate with a cloud platform over
various protocols. It acts both as data ingestion plane, and as control plane. In short, Drogue IoT Cloud takes
care of the data on the cloud side :grin:.

![Overview diagram](docs/modules/ROOT/images/architecture.svg)

It offers:
* IoT friendly protocol endpoints and APIs
* Protocol normalization based on Cloud Events
* Management of device credentials and properties
* APIs, a CLI, and a graphical console to manage devices and data flows

It is built on top of:
* *Kubernetes* – For running workloads
* *Cloud Events* - For normalizing transport protocols
* *Knative (eventing)* – For streaming data
* *Apache Kafka* – For persisting events
* *Keycloak* - For single-sign-on

You can learn more about the [architecture](https://book.drogue.io/drogue-cloud/dev/architecture/index.html) in
our [documentation](https://book.drogue.io/).

## Protocol Endpoint Support

| Protocols                  |     Endpoint    |
| -------------------------- | :-------------: |
| HTTP                       |        ✓        |
| MQTT v3/v5                 |        ✓        |
| CoAP                       |        ✓*       |

_\* - has no DTLS support, authentication done using [custom CoAP options](https://github.com/drogue-iot/rfcs/blob/main/active/0007-cloudevent-to-coap-options.md#mappings-of-drogue-iot-extension-attributes-to-coap-option-numbers)(no encryption)_ 

## Installation

Take a look at the [deployment instructions](https://book.drogue.io/drogue-cloud/dev/deployment/).

If you know what you are doing, the next sections give you a quick may of deploying the "latest" version of Drogue Cloud.

### Minikube

~~~shell
minikube start --cpus 4 --memory 16384 --disk-size 20gb --addons ingress
minikube tunnel # run this in a separate terminal, as it needs to keep running
make deploy CLUSTER=minikube
~~~

### Kind

~~~shell
kind create cluster --config=deploy/kind/cluster-config.yaml
make deploy CLUSTER=kind
~~~
