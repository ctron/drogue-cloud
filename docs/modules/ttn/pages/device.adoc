This will register a new device, and synchronized it with The Things Network.

=== Pre-requisites

You will need the following information for your device:

* Device EUI
* Application/Join EUI
* Application Key
* Supported LoRa capabilities

=== Procedure

Create a new device in Drogue Cloud:

[source,shell]
----
drg create --app my-ttn-app device my-ttn-device-1
----

Next, add the TTN specific information:

[source,json]
----
{
    "spec": {
        "ttn": {
            "app_eui": "0123456789ABCDEF",
            "app_key": "0123456789ABCDEF...",
            "dev_eui": "0123456789ABCDEF",
            "frequency_plan_id": "...", <1>
            "lorawan_phy_version": "...", <2>
            "lorawan_version": "..." <3>
        }
    }
}
----
<1> An ID of the TTN supported frequency plans, e.g. `EU_863_870_TTN`
<2> An ID of the TTN supported LoRa versions, e.g. `PHY_V1_0`
<3> An ID of the TTN supported LoRa version, e.g. `MAC_V1_0`

## Deleting a device

When you delete a device in Drogue Cloud, it will also be deleted in the TTN system.

## Disconnecting a device

If you want to delete the device in TTN, but keep it in Drogue Cloud, then you can simply
remove or rename the `.spec.ttn` section.
