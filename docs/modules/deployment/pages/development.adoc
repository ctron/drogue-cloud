= Deploying from the repository

Instead of running the installer, which installs a released version of Drogue Cloud, you can also directly from the
repository, using `:latest` images instead. The same way, you can also deploy your custom-built images.

[IMPORTANT]
.`main` and tagged versions
====
Deploying from the repository implies that you install `latest` or `main`. Even when you check out a tag or branch from
the repository, this will always install `latest`. If you want to install a tagged version, use the installer.
====

== Additional pre-requisites

Additionally, you will need to:

* `git`
* Clone the `drogue-cloud` repository

== Deploy standard images

Installing Drogue Cloud, using the standard images, can be done by calling the "installation" script (`drgadm`)
directly from the repository:

[source,bash]
----
./script/drgadm deploy
----

TIP: This is the same script as from the installer packages explained before. Thus is accepts the same variables/options.

== Deploy custom images

If you built custom images, and pushed them to a container repository:

[source,bash]
----
make CONTAINER_REGISTRY=quay.io/my-repo build images
----

You can install them using:

[source,bash]
----
make CONTAINER_REGISTRY=quay.io/my-repo deploy
----
